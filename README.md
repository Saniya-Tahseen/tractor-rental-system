## 📌 Project Overview
In rural agricultural clusters (such as Hasanparthy, Bheemaram, Velair, Dharmasagar, Kazipet), many farmers have farm lands requiring timely machinery, while local tractor owners have idle machinery slots. 

**AgriRent** solves rural agricultural coordination by:
1. Eliminating awkward price and slot negotiations over phone calls.
2. Automating **instant slot availability verification** via WhatsApp and an **In-App Tractor Owner Inbox**.
3. Providing clear dynamic pricing based on land area ($Acres \times 1.5 \text{ hrs} \times Rate$).
4. Issuing verifiable **Digital Agricultural Work Passes / Slips** with QR verification and print support.
